# Custom Authentication Using Appsmith and APISIX

Authentication flow is a fundamental part of web applications. It ensures the security and privacy of user data while they are using your app. While there are many off-the-shelf authentication solutions available, building an authentication system using **a low-code UI development platform** and **API management solution** allows you to create secure web applications with ease. You can create an application **without having knowledge of both frontend and backend technologies and tools**. You do not need to know Python, Java, HTML, CSS, or other JavaScript frameworks. This repo demontrates how to build a custom simple login flow and pages on UI to secure your application using [Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com/), [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/), and [JWT](https://jwt.io/).

## How to run the project?

### Before you begin

- Install Appsmith: You can learn how to [install Appsmith using Docker](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/docker) on the Appsmith website. Make sure that you installed Appsmith and you can access it at [http://localhost](http://localhost/). When you deploy and run Appsmith, an application titled `My first application` is added by default. You can use this application to build your first app.

To run the project, run `docker compose up` command from the project root folder.
